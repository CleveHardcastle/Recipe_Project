# SAVVORY

## DESCRIPTION 

This web based application will search through two different APIs to return results from both a recipe API and YouTube’s API for both a text recipe and a video tutorial of whatever dish you’re looking to cook. 

The motivation for this project was for this group to better learn how to work with and utilize APIs and new web frameworks towards the goal of building a functioning real world application. In addition to learning the Git workflow for group collaborative projects. Essential skills that’ll take us beyond our bootcamp experiences and will be invaluable in our development careers. 

The problem that this application looks to solve is the task of combing through many websites whenever you’re looking for directions for a recipe (especially the dreaded ten plus paragraphs of the author's personal story about how this recipe came to be. Things that really don’t need to be included when all you’re interested in is learning how to cook the darn thing!). 

Throughout this project we learned and strengthened many of the skills we have learned through our first month in our bootcamp. Working with APIs was one such thing we’ve been introduced to that was a major part of getting this project to work. Next, web frameworks. We were required to use one that we’d not covered yet in class. We chose to use TailwindCSS as our preferred framework. It definitely was difficult to get a brand new framework you’ve never used before working in a short time, but we managed to persevere and get it working in the end.  

## USAGE
